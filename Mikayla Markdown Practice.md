# Interest in Digital Archaeology
* It is the future of the career field
* It could potentially be a leg up when it comes to hiring
* Marketability

##### What ODAT says - seems legit
> Digital tools exist in a meshwork of legal and cultural obligations, and moreso than any other tool humans have yet come up with, have the capability to exert their own agency upon the user. Digital tools and their use are not theory-free nor without theoretical implications. There is no such thing as neutral, when digital tools are employed. This is why digital archaeology is - or should be - a distinct specialization in the wider archaeological project.
